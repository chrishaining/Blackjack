# Blackjack

## This is a simple version of the classic card game. You can play it through the terminal.

### Set up
To write this program I used:
* The IntelliJ IDE
* JUnit testing
* To play the game, run the Runner file inside src/main/java.

### THE BRIEF
### MVP
* Deal two cards to a dealer and a player
* Compare the hands
* Determine the winner from who has the highest value hand

## BlackJack rules
* Aces may be counted as 1 or 11 points, 2 to 9 according to card value, and tens and face cards count as ten points.

* The value of a hand is the sum of the point values of the individual cards.

* Except, a "blackjack" is the highest hand, consisting of an ace and any 10-point card, and it outranks all other 21-point hands.

* To start dealer will give two cards to each player and two cards to himself. One of the dealer cards is dealt face up.
